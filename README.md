# Javascript-Set-Example

## A personal implementation of a Set Data Structure in Javascript.

In programming, a **Set** is a data structure that works similar to an array but only allows unique values. Sets also come with the methods *union*, *intersection* , *difference* and *subset*. These methods facilitate uniting and comparing sets.


### This implementation of the Set class has the following methods:

##### 1. Has - Checks if an element is already present in the Set, returns a Boolean.

##### 2. Values - Returns the Set Collection.

##### 3. Add(element) - Takes an element and adds it to the Set if it's not present in it. If the element is already present in the set or if it's an invalid type, returns false.

##### 4. Remove(element) - Takes an element and removes it from the Set if it's present in it.

##### 5. Size - Returns the Set's length.

##### 6. Union(otherSet) - Unites two Sets together in a new Set and returns the result.

##### 7. Intersection(otherSet) - Compares two Sets and returns a new Set that only contains the values that are present in both. 

##### 8. Difference(otherSet) - Compares two Sets (SetA and SetB) and returns a new Set that has all the values of SetA that aren't present in SetB and all the values of SetB that aren't present in SetA (the difference between both Sets).

##### 9. Subset(otherSet) - Checks if all the values of a Set are included in another Set, returns a Boolean.
